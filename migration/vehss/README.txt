The contents of this directory are a subset of the VEHSS repository's shared "vehss"
package, which implement some operations that were useful here as well.

They were copied over from commit 991b346212735d72313a31a07a5af170c185a8fb.

Eventually, it would be nice to extract this code into a package that could be explicitly shared.
Also, it could use some refactoring, and better naming -- which would involve figuring out what these
operations are "actually" called, if they are "actually" called anything.
